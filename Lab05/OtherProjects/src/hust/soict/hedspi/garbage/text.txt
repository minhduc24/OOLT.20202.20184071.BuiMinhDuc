First, you should choose a text that you think is interesting. Maybe you like reading about history, or maybe you find the news more interesting. Lots of students like to read fiction, like stories or novels.
You must also choose a text that is right for your English level. If the reading is too difficult, you will be frustrated and you will not enjoy your reading practice.
Finally, you should choose a text that is short. The best reading material is short enough for you to read it all at once. This is why short stories are such a great option!
Whether you read the text in class with your teacher or on your own, it is best if you can read it from start to finish without stopping for a break.
